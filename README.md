# Shaadi
 

Tech stack used:
1. Dagger-Hilt
2. Retrofit
3. Kotlin coroutines
4. Room db
5. Kotlin MVVM

Note: Code will successfully fetch network data from retrofit and stores in Room db. As I was not given layout design, I did not implement CardView. When I requested cardview design I was told to create shaadi profile. I created shaadi account even I am not ready for any match to see layout but someone has to request to see accept reject cardview. Because of this I did not get chance to see layout and did not implemented UI.
